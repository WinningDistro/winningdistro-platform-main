## 🔐 Authentication System Testing

### 1. Registration Flow Test

**Test User Data:**
```json
{
  "email": "testartist@winningdistro.com",
  "password": "SecurePass123",
  "firstName": "Test",
  "lastName": "Artist",
  "artistName": "Test Artist",
  "country": "US"
}
```

**Registration URL**: http://localhost:5173/register

**Step-by-Step Test:**
1. ✅ Navigate to registration page
2. ✅ Fill out all required fields with test data
3. ✅ Form validation works (email format, password strength)
4. ✅ Submit triggers API call to `/api/auth/register`
5. ✅ Backend validates data and creates user record
6. ✅ Password gets hashed with bcryptjs
7. ✅ JWT token generated and returned
8. ✅ User automatically logged in
9. ✅ Redirect to dashboard occurs
10. ✅ Token stored in localStorage

**Expected Backend Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "user": {
    "id": "uuid-string",
    "email": "testartist@winningdistro.com",
    "name": "Test Artist",
    "artistName": "Test Artist",
    "verified": false,
    "plan": "free"
  }
}
```

### 2. Login Flow Test

**Login URL**: http://localhost:5173/login

**Test Steps:**
1. ✅ Navigate to login page
2. ✅ Enter test credentials
3. ✅ Form validation prevents invalid submissions
4. ✅ Submit triggers API call to `/api/auth/login`
5. ✅ Backend verifies password hash
6. ✅ JWT token generated for valid credentials
7. ✅ User data cached in localStorage
8. ✅ Redirect to dashboard
9. ✅ Navigation updates with user info

**Authentication Persistence Test:**
1. ✅ Login successfully
2. ✅ Refresh browser page
3. ✅ User remains logged in (token from localStorage)
4. ✅ Protected routes accessible
5. ✅ User data restored from cache
